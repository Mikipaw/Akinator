Do you think you are good at geography?  
Do you know a lot of different information about each country?  
Or you just want to know new information about countries?  
This game is for you! Try to play with Oracle and find country you wish due to answer on
general questions only. For now Oracle knows almost all countries
(excepts: some islands in Pacific ocean and Caribbean sea).
But you may a chance to add these counties in your own database.

Have a fun! Good luck!
